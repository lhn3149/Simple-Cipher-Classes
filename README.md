# Simple-Cipher-Classes
Implement Caesar and XOR Cipher with classes' inheritance and polymorphism.

Caesar cipher
===
The Caesar cipher is simple substitution cipher that replaces a letter
with another letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher for more complete inforamtion.

For this homework Pseudo code is provided to help you along the way.

XOR Cipher
===
The XOR cipher is a simple addative ciper that uses the XOR operator
to encode/decode a message. The cipher simply XOR a character with 
and another key character. 

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher more information.

Input Provided main
===
1. Name of cipher to use (Caesar or XOR)
2. Specific cipher info
   Shift amount for Caesar
   Key for XOR  
3. Action (DECODE/ENCODE)
4. Message to encode/decode

Example:
Caesar
3
DECODE
XYZ
